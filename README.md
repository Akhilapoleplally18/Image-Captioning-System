**🧠 Image Captioning System**

This project is an AI-powered Image Captioning System that automatically generates descriptive captions for any given image. It combines computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to interpret visual content and express it in natural human language.

**🚀 Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between images and language by developing a model that understands image content and generates meaningful captions.
It leverages deep learning architectures — specifically CNNs for visual feature extraction and RNNs/LSTMs (with Transformers integration) for sequence generation.

**🧩 Key Features**

🖼️ Accepts any image as input and produces descriptive captions

⚙️ Uses ResNet for feature extraction

🧠 Employs LSTM and Transformer-based decoder for sentence generation

📊 Trained on large-scale datasets (e.g., MS COCO, TextCaps)

💡 Modular, easy-to-extend notebook — ideal for experimentation or fine-tuning

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Transformers (Hugging Face)

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

MS COCO Dataset / TextCaps Dataset

**🧪 Workflow Summary**

Feature Extraction: Use a pre-trained CNN (ResNet) to extract visual embeddings.

Text Processing: Tokenize captions and build vocabulary.

Model Training: Combine CNN + LSTM/Transformer to learn image–text relationships.

Caption Generation: Generate new captions for unseen images.

**📸 Example Output**

Input: An image of a child holding a red balloon.
Output: “A young child is standing outside holding a red balloon.”

**📚 Future Improvements**

Fine-tune transformer-based captioning (e.g., ViT + GPT-2)

Add beam search for better caption diversity

Deploy model as a web app with Flask or Streamlit
